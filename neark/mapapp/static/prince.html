            This Prince residency one most famous is pudukkotai there are so many paintings
            and stachues are there and it is contructed and it most popural
            "Pudukkottai residency" could refer to Pudukkottai State, a former kingdom and princely state in India,
             or it could refer to The Residency, Karur, a hotel in a nearby city managed by The Residency Group. There are also several guest houses and lodges in Pudukkottai itself,
             though no single establishment is widely known as "The Pudukkottai Residency".
